This is a study-tracker I built for practice while taking a frontend development classes. It takes a variety of inputs for each task (task name, assigned date, due date, estimated time needed to complete task, and notes) from the user and creates a checklist. The user can remove items once they are done. It uses HTML, CSS, React, node.js and Javascript.
